# **Marketplace Builder Hackathon Summary**  

The Marketplace Builder Hackathon was an amazing experience where I learned many new and valuable things. I gained practical knowledge about starting a business, working on real-world projects, improving website performance, and making it user-friendly. This hackathon helped me think more broadly and understand the importance of planning before starting development.  

This hackathon was also special because it helped me build my reputation in my class. During a practice hackathon, I created documentation on **ShipEngine**, which **Sir Ameen Alam** reposted on LinkedIn with kind comments. This was an unforgettable moment for me. May Allah bless Sir Ameen Alam for the great work he is doing for GIAIC students!

## **Day 1: Planning and Choosing a Niche**  
On the first day, we had to select the type of marketplace we wanted to build: general e-commerce, quick commerce, or rental commerce. I chose general e-commerce. We then identified a problem to solve, researched a niche, and wrote down ideas. I learned how to think with a business mindset and plan effectively.

## **Day 2: Technical Documentation and Workflow**  
On the second day, we created technical documentation. This included designing the workflow of how users interact with the website, defining schemas, and selecting the tools we would use. I learned how to set up the technical foundation of a website and make it more user-friendly.

## **Day 3: Data Migration and Integration**  
On the third day, we migrated data from an API to Sanity using scripts. We also managed schemas based on the data and integrated it into the frontend. Since I had practiced data migration in a previous hackathon, this task was easy for me. I learned how to handle large-scale data and connect it smoothly to the frontend.
